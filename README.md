# Pac-Man is Dead
Welcome to my project: 'Pac-Man is Dead'. My name is Arthur Hayden and
Pac-Man is dead.

## Why is Pac-Man Dead?
Why do bad things happen?

## Usage
This program can be used to illustrate our impending doom. While Pac-Man energetically seeks truth from left to right, once he comes to grips with the futility of his struggle (at the max window width) he abandons his previous disposition and transforms into a zombie.

Pac-Man's return to normalcy at the left-most bounds of the window symbolizes how connection with others and mindfulness can erode even the thickest walls that we surround ourselves with.

However, time waits for no Pac-(Wo)Man; thusly, his inevitable demise can not be escaped. Until I learn how to code power pellets, of course.

## Wait, what is this actually?
This is a README file. How informative!

## Can you actually code?
No.

## Are you learning?
Sort of.
